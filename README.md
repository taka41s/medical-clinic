# Ambush Journey Program - Medical Clinic

This is a repository used by the AJP Backend team to practice building a web server in Go, developing a software for a medical clinic.

The software is used for scheduling, planning and managing medical appointments, as well as medical exams and services.

## Workflows and Rules

Project tasks and user stories are listed in [Trello](https://trello.com/b/UtCP3tht/ajp-medical-clinic)

Branch guidelines should follow the syntax `<type>/<subject>` where \<type\> should be one of `feat`, `bugfix`, `test` or `chore`, and \<subject\> should be a very short description on the changes made.

Commit messages can follow the same guidelines from branches, but it's not necessary as long as it describes the changes made clearly.

Make sure to have `go fmt` running on your editor's save process. For VS Code you can follow the instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53513867).

Once you have finished your changes on your feature branch, please open a pull request to the main branch and add the mentors as reviewers.
